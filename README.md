# pyMAP++ 

This is the python module fork of the [Mooring Analysis Program (MAP++)](https://github.com/old-NWTC/MAP) to make it a more pythonic module.

Author: [NREL WISDEM Team](mailto:systems.engineering@nrel.gov) 

## Documentation

MAP++ is a library used for modeling underwater mooring systems quasi-statically. MAP++ can be used in Python to prototype and design mooring systems, or hook into other dynamic simulation codes.

More information on the theory behind MAP++ is described [here](http://cim.mcgill.ca/~mmascio1/ISOPE2013-TPC-0646.pdf), with the hopes to extend capabilities as described [here](http://cim.mcgill.ca/~mmascio1/61159.pdf). MAP++ is licensed under Apache version 2.

## Prerequisites

pyMAP requires a C++ compiler

## Installation

For detailed installation instructions of WISDEM modules see <https://github.com/WISDEM/WISDEM> or to install pyMAP by itself do:

    $ python -m pip install numpy
    $ python setup.py install
